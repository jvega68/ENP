Survival Times and White Blood Counts for Leukaemia Patients

SUMMARY:
       The leuk data frame has 33 rows and 3 columns.

       Survival times are given for 33  patients  who  died  from
       acute   myelogenous  leukaemia.   Also  measured  was  the
       patient's white blood cell count at the time of diagnosis.
       The patients were also factored into 2 groups according to
       the presence or absence of a morphologic characteristic of
       white  blood  cells.  Patients  termed  AG  positive  were
       identified  by  the   presence   of   Auer   rods   and/or
       significant  granulation   of  the  leukaemic cells in the
       bone marrow at the time of diagnosis.

DATA DESCRIPTION:
       This data frame contains the following columns:

wbc:   White blood cell count.
ag:    Factor describing the patients group according to the test
       described above.  Levels are present and absent.
time:     Survival time in weeks after diagnosis.
