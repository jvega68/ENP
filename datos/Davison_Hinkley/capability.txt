Simulated Manufacturing Process Data

SUMMARY:
       The capability data frame has 75 rows and 1 columns.

       The data are  simulated  successive  observations  from  a
       process  in  equilibrium.   The process is assumed to have
       specification limits (5.49, 5.79).

DATA DESCRIPTION:
       This data frame contains the following column:

y:     The simulated measurements.

       The data were obtained from

       index?  Applied Statistics, 39, 331-340.
