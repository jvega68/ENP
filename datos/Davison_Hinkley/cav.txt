Position of Muscle Caveolae

SUMMARY:
       The cav data frame has 138 rows and 2 columns.

       The data gives the positions of the individual caveolae in
       a square region with sides of length 500 units.  This grid
       was originally on a 2.65um square of  muscle  fibre.   The
       data  are  those  points  falling  in  the lower left hand
       quarter of the region used for the dataset caveolae.dat in
       the  spatial  library  by  B.D.  Ripley  (1994)  which  is
       available from Statlib

DATA DESCRIPTION:
       This data frame contains the following columns:

x:     The x coordinate of the caveola's position in the region.
y:     The y coordinate of the caveola's position in the region.
