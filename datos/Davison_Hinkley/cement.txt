Cement Composition Data

SUMMARY:
       The cement data frame has 13 rows and 5 columns.

       13 samples of Portland cement were set. For  each  sample,
       the  percentages of the four main chemical ingredients was
       accurately measured.  While the  cement  was  setting  the
       amount of heat evolved was also measured.

DATA DESCRIPTION:
       This data frame contains the following columns:

x1:    The percentage by weight of tricalcium  aluminate  in  the
       sample.
x2:    The percentage by weight of tricalcium  silictate  in  the
       sample.
x3:    The percentage by weight of tricalcium alumino ferrite  in
       the sample.
x4:    The percentage by weight of  dicalcium  silictate  in  the
       sample.
y:     The heat (in calories per gramme of cement) evolved  while
       the sample was setting.
