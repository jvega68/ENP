Failure Time of PET Film

SUMMARY:
       The hirose data frame has 44 rows and 3 columns.

       PET film  is  used  in  electrical  insulation.   In  this
       accelerated  life test the failure times for 44 samples in
       gas insulated transformers.  4  different  voltage  levels
       were used.

DATA DESCRIPTION:
       This data frame contains the following columns:

volt:     The voltage (in kV).
time:     The failure or censoring time in hours.
cens:     The censoring indicator; 1 means right-censored data.

SOURCE:
       The data were obtained from

       accelerated    life-testing.     IEEE    Transactions   on
       Reliability, 42, 650-657.
