The file INDEX.txt contains the names of the data as listed

For each data, say darwin (Darwin's Plant Height Differences), 
three files exit:

darwin.dat    :  the data tabulated in ASCII format                
darwin.txt    :  the help file for the data
darwin.xlsdat :  the data separated by ";" in ASCII format


Have fun :-)
