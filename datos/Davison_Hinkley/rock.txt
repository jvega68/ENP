Measurements on Petroleum Rock Samples

SUMMARY:
       The rock data frame has 48 rows and 4 columns.

       Twelve core samples from petroleum reservoirs were sampled
       by  4  cross-sections.   Each core sample was measured for
       permeability, and each cross-section  has  total  area  of
       pores, total perimeter of pores, and shape.

DATA DESCRIPTION:
       This data frame contains the following columns:

area:     The area of the pores space (in pixels  out  of  256  x
       256).
peri:     The total perimeter of the pores (in pixels).
shape:      The   shape   of   the   pores   space   defined   as
       peri/sqrt(area).
perm:     The permeability in milli-Darcies.
