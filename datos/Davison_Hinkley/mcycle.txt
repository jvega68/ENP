Data from a Simulated Motorcycle Accident

SUMMARY:
       The mcycle data frame has 133 rows and 2 columns.

       In an experiment  to  test  crash  helmets,  a  series  of
       measurements   of  head  acceleration  after  a  simulated
       motorcycle crash were recorded.

DATA DESCRIPTION:
       This data frame contains the following columns:
times:    The time in milliseconds since impact.
accel:    The recorded head acceleration (in g).

       The data were obtained from

       smoothing   approach   to  non-parametric  curve  fitting.
