Beaver Body Temperature Data

SUMMARY:
       The beaver data frame has 100 rows and 4 columns.  It is a
       multivariate  time series of class "rts" and also inherits
       from class "data.frame".

       This  data  set  is  part  of  a  long  study  into   body
       temperature  regulation  in  beavers.   Four  adult female
       beavers were live-trapped and had a  temperature-sensitive
       radiotransmitter   surgically  implanted.   Readings  were
       taken every 10 minutes.  The location of  the  beaver  was
       also  recorded  and her activity level was dichotomized by
       whether she was in the retreat  or  outside  of  it  since
       high-intensity   activities  only  occur  outside  of  the
       retreat.

       The data in this data frame are those readings for one  of
       the beavers on a day in autumn.

DATA DESCRIPTION:
       This data frame contains the following columns:

day:   The day number.  The data includes only data from day  307
       and early 308.
time:     The time of day formatted as hour-minute.
temp:     The body temperature in degrees Celsius.
activ:    The dichotomized activity indicator. 1  indicates  that
       the beaver is outside of the retreat and therefore engaged
       in high-intensity activity.
